        Who is Super Good Marketing?
      </h2>
      <p>
        My name is Gaege and I've been working professionally in the tech and digital marketing space for 12 years. What
        started with building super basic websites in the early 2000s became a lifelong passion that has grown into
        developing enterprise-level applications and marketing assets serving millions of users per year.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After years of serving all types of clients big and small as a freelancer, I decided to apply my technical and
        managerial skills in a focused effort to help businesses in the fast-paced and complicated world of legal
        cannabis products.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I look forward to helping your dispensary flourish and alleviating some of the stress that I know comes with
        business ownership, especially in such a high-intensity industry.
